# 👋 Hi, I’m Sravani Siddanthapu  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m passionate about building **real-time conversational voice assistants** that make technology more natural and human. 
- Currently, I’m developing a **Real-Time Conversational Voice Assistant** that integrates **speech recognition (STT), large language models (LLMs), and speech synthesis (TTS)** to achieve low-latency, human-like interactions.  
- In parallel, I’m expanding my expertise in **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** to design, deploy, and scale modern applications on the cloud.
